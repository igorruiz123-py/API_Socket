# Socket API

Simple and demonstrative Socket API, simulating a socket client and a socket server exchanging data.

Gathering Networking and TCP/IP stack concepts, this repository aims to understand more how communication between client and server machines really works.

# How it works?

Through the terminal a client socket is performed by the user who establishes a connection with the socket server.
Once the connection is establhised the client can send message to and receive messages from the server.
